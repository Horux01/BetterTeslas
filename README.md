# BetterTeslas

Allows the server owners to customize Tesla Gates with various options availables like:
- Ignore certains Teams or Roles
- Ignore players that have certains effects active like godmode, noclip, etc...
- Full support with CustomItems and CustomRoles (not needing to have the .dll in the folder)
- And more coming soon...

Any idea of what could be added send a message in discord.
